# Database Systems Project ðŸ“Š

This repository contains the implementation of a relational database system using MySQL and Flask, covering various aspects of database design, querying, back-end development, and stored programs.

ðŸ“š **Features**
- Database design and schema creation
- SQL queries for data retrieval and statistical analysis
- Database normalization to 3rd normal form (3NF)
- Back-end development using Flask for CRUD operations
- Implementation of stored procedures, triggers, and functions in MySQL
- Data integrity constraints and logging mechanisms

ðŸ›  **Technologies**
- **MySQL**: For database management and querying.
- **Flask**: For developing a back-end web service.
- **SQL**: For creating and manipulating the database.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project deployment.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**
- Provide practical examples of database design and normalization.
- Implement back-end logic for interacting with the database using Flask.
- Showcase various SQL operations (CRUD) and advanced database functionalities like stored procedures and triggers.

ðŸš€ **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/database_systems.git
   cd database_systems
   ```
2. Set up the MySQL database and import the schema.
3. Run the Flask application to test CRUD operations.
4. Test API calls with Postman.
